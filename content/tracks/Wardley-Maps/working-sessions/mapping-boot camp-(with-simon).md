## WHY

A Wardley map is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or user.
Maps help to communicate, challenge, plan, learn, and mitigate risk. 

Put into practice, this helps bring to life your future prospects, explore the most opportune reactions to change – or even pre-empt it – and highlight the supporting role played by technology for inspiring clear competitive advantage. At the same time, Mapping equips you with advanced techniques for gaming that competitive environment to your own advantage.
