Take a step back from your day to day work in cyber security, and look at the challenges you face more abstractly. What do specific challenges remind you of, what are the factors that determine whether you succeed or fail?

## WHY

By looking at the challenges we face abstractly, away from the day to day docket of tasks that must simply be dealt with as quickly as possible, we can find better ways of preventing fires rather than always putting them out.

## What

The track organiser will submit some initial suggestions, based on his previous work, and the discussion will proceed from there.

## Outcomes

* Arguments for using analogies or metaphors as a way to find new strategies.
* Arguments against using analogies or metaphors as a way to find new strategies.
* Examples of games, conflicts, concepts, methodologies, that can be applied to cyber security.
