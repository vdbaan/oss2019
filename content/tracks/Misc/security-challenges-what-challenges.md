If we're all so smart, and are working so hard, why does everything seem so awful?

## WHY

Considering how intelligent security practioners are, how well funded they are, and how hard they work, it feels as though the industry should be obtaining better results than it is currently receiving.

Therefore there must be something systematically wrong with the way that cyber security is being run, and must be a way to achieve better results with the same resources.

## What

The current plan is that there will be some kind of introduction by the track organiser, followed by a round table discussion of the issues raised.

## Outcomes

* Introduction to the general hypothesis that, for the intelligence of the people involved, and the resources dedicated to the task, that cyber security is less effective than it should be, and therefore that the overall strategy determine how resources are used is flawed.
* Determine who interested parties are, or if there is sufficient interest, as this is a more wide-ranging subject area than most for the summit.
