Wednesday is a busy day for the summit, and some participants may have commitments elsewhere, such as at InfoSec Europe and BSides London. Therefore, wherever you are today, spend your time looking at what strategies and assumptons are already in use:

## WHY

By looking at the challenges we face abstractly, away from the day to day docket of tasks that must simply be dealt with as quickly as possible, we can find better ways of preventing fires rather than always putting them out.

## Examples

The track organiser's examples of the understated assumptions and strategies already in play:

* Bug bounty companies: that sufficient coverage of security vulnerabilities exploited by teams of motivated attackers can be achieved using a horde of enthusiasts working largely without co-ordination.
* Conference organisers and training vendors: that individual technical excellence is the most important factor when determining the success or failure of a cyber security endeavour, such as attacking or defending an organisation.
* DevSecOps: that sufficient staff can be found to cover the combined intellectual requirements of at least three traditionally distinct disciplines.
* Firewall vendors: that is possible, and optimal, to prevent most compromises before they achieve any intrusion on to any part of an estate rather than using initial intrusions as high fidelity information on attacks.
* Penetration testing: that it is possible to find a sufficient number of issues with a system by looking at externally, that an adversarial mindset is best employed in relatively small and time-boxed activities.
* Threat Intelligence: that attackers change their methods so infrequently that IOCs are of value. And that that intelligence is best shared among relatively small groups of trusted peers rather than more widely.
* User education services: that internal networks cannot be secured, and that users - as the perimeter for an organisation at the application layer - must be hardened against attack.

## Outcomes

Participants generate their own list of strategies which they see in play, and submit them to an agreed location on thie Github, or present them on the Thursday.
