The final session needs careful thought, so this will be updated.

## Outcomes

Answers to the original questions:

* What are current strategies, explicit or implicit, that the industry uses or advocates as a whole?
* What are the underlying assumptions of the current strategies? Are those underlying assumptions valid?
* Assuming those strategies are incorrect, what are the correct strategies the industry should be using, to solve the problems it faces?
* What methodologies should be used to create or find, and test, the correct strategies?
* Can we learn from other practitioners in related areas as a useable "hack" to choose effective new strategies rapidly?
* Is this area of study financially or practically viable?
