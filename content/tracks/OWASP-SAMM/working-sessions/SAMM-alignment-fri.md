OWASP SAMM is an overarching model that provides a framework to reason about application security in the broadest sense. To ensure the relevance and usefulness of activities, we will align the content thereof with subject matter experts from other OWASP projects. This will ensure that the objective, suggestions and measurement questions are supported by the OWASP community. If you are involved in an OWASP project that links with OWASP SAMM, you're more than welcome to join and give your feedback. We will also pro-actively reach out to particular OWASP members and projects to discuss this.

Session Requirements: Familiarity with the OWASP SAMM project.
