SAMM is conceived as a methodology agnostic model. The specificities for a particular methodology such as DevOps are specified in a separate guidance document. In this session, we want to work on a guidance document for DevOps. If you're familiar with DevOps-based development, we very much would like to hear from you on how to support this using SAMM v2 !

Session Requirements: Familiarity with the SAMM v1.5 and v2 model
