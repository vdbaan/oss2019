One of the core challenges for SAMM v2 is the new way of measuring maturity according to the core model. While in the past, measurements have been focussing on coverage, we're also looking into measuring quality of implementation. In this (and the previous) session, we want to take a final decision on this topic.

Session Requirements: Familiarity with the SAMM v1.5 and v2 model
