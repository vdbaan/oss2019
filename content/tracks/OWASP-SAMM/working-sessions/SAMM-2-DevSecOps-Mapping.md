OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model activities reference, based on Timo Pagels opinion, to OWASP SAMM activities.

Check out https://dsomm.timo-pagel.de/report-samm.php

Questions:
* Is the current mapping valid?
* Some DSOMM activities are not easy to map to SAMM, where should it belong to? (Is it accepted/expected/questioned to have mappings for one DSOMM activity to multiple SAMM activities?)
* Are the differences of having activities of maturity level 3 in SAMM and in OWASP DSOMM on maturity 1 accepted/expected/questioned?

Outcome:
* OWASP SAMM team verfies by mapping that no important actvities are missing
* OWASP SAMM might add references to OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model
* OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model will have a more precise mapping
