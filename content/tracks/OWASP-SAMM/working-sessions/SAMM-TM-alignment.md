OWASP SAMM is an overarching model that provides a framework to reason about application security in the broadest sense. To ensure the relevance and usefulness of activities, we will align the content thereof with subject matter experts from other OWASP projects. This will ensure that the objective, suggestions and measurement questions are supported by the OWASP community. 
In this session, we want to discuss the Threat Modeling stream in particular.

Session Requirements: Familiarity with v2 of the OWASP SAMM project.
