One of the key success factors for SAMM is the availability of comparitative data available for the organisations adopting it. One of the challenges is to have a sufficiently open data set that at the same time guarantees anonymity and sufficient quality of data. A potential solution to these challenges was designed in the past. In this session, we want to discuss how to move this forward.

Session Requirements: Familiarity with the OWASP SAMM v1.5 and v2 models.
