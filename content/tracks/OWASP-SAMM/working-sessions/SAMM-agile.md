SAMM is conceived as a methodology agnostic model. The specificities for a particular methodology such as Agile are specified in a separate guidance document. 
In this session, we want to discuss the guidance document for Agile, which has already been developeds. We want to discuss the mapping and suggestions with you to understand where this can further improve.
