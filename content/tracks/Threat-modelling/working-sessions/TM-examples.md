## WHY

This working session will kick start the OWASP Project!

## What

We created that repository last year: https://github.com/OWASP/threat-model-cookbook.

This year another project code named "Threat Model Examples" was in the work, and now it will merge and be the Cookbooks since it's pretty much the same project idea.


## Outcomes

- Explanation on the way of working
- Leadership of the project defined
- Naming of the project decided (cookbooks or cookbook?)
- Restructuration of repository (access rights, folders and files)
- Registration of the project started
