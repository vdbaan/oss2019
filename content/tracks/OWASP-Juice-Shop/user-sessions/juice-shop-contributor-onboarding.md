## Why

Pick up session for all participants who are interested in contributing
to the OWASP Juice Shop project but have no experience with its code
base yet.

## What

* Architecture overview
* Contribution guidelines
* How a hacking challenge is implemented and tested
* CI/CD pipeline

This is **not** a basic introduction into the project itself! For this
we recommend to participate in the [Juice Shop 101](/tracks/owasp-juice-shop/user-sessions/juice-shop-101/)
session!
