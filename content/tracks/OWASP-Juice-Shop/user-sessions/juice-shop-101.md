## Why

Pick up session for all participants who are interested in the OWASP
Juice Shop project but have no experience with it yet.

## What

Target audience are all interested users from _Breaker_, _Builder_ and
_Defender_ communities alike!

* Demo of the project
* Installation walk-through
* Advanced features (CTF mode, custom themes etc.)

This is **not** an introduction into the code base or underlying
technology! For this we recommend to participate in the
[Juice Shop Contributor Onboarding](/tracks/owasp-juice-shop/user-sessions/juice-shop-contributor-onboarding/)
session and join any of the evening
[Juice Shop Hack'n'Code](/tracks/owasp-juice-shop/working-sessions/juice-shop-hackathon/) evening session series!
