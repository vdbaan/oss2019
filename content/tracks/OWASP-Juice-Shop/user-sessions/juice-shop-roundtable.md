## Why

Friendly get-together (possibly over lunch) to talk and exchange
experience about the OWASP Juice Shop.

## What

No agenda set in stone for this one. Just bring your questions, ideas,
quirks and bugs with you to the open discussion! Some ideas others might be particularly interested in:

* Which is your favorite hacking challenge and why?
* How are you using Juice Shop in your company/university/...?
* Are you using the "vanilla" theme or your own corporate theme?
* What experience have you made with running a CTF on the Juice Shop?
* ...
