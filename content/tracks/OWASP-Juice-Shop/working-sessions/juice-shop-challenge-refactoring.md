description  : Refactoring the categories and difficulty ratings of the OWASP Juice Shop challenges
organizers   : Bjoern Kimminich

## Why

The Juice Shop offers 85+ hacking challenges spread across 6 difficulty
levels. It is time to review their categories and difficulty ratings for
overall consistency and possible improvements.

## What

* Discuss the need for more (or less?) challenge categories
  * Map to additional existing vulnerability catalogs
* Discuss the need for more (or less?) difficulty levels
  * Define criteria to map challenges to difficulties more easily (e.g.
    _"Scripting needed?"_ or _"Multi-step attack required?"_)
  * Map the existing challenge to the aligned difficulty levels

## Outcomes

This working session can result in e.g.

* pros and cons of the current categorization and difficulty rating
  schemes
* recommendation for new categories (or ones to be removed/merged)
* recommendation for changes in the difficulty levels
* mapping to get from the current state to the proposed new state

The documentation of all the above will be put into (or referred to by)
a GitHub issue in the
[Juice Shop repository](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop).
