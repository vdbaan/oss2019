The goal of the [OWASP Honeypot Project](https://github.com/OWASP/Honeypot-Project/) is to identify emerging attacks against web applications and report them to the community, in order to facilitate protection against such targeted attacks.

Based around the earlier OWASP/WASC Distributed Web Honeypots Project (https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-distributed-web-honeypots) this project extends on sharing the findings, reproducibility, and simplifying the adoption for the community.

## Why

There is an ongoing GSoC project, proposed by Tulja Vamshi Kiran, to work on it. Both project leaders will be in the Summit so coordination is a must.

## What

The session will focus on discussing the topics of the project.

## Outcomes

Revised deliveries on the activities of the project:
- Review timeline and activities
- Additional needs for project participants
- Discussion
- How to share findings

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

-  Developers
-  Security professionals
-  DevOps / DevSecOps
-  AppSec leaders
