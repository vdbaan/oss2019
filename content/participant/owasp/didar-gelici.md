Didar has 10+ years in total spent cross all three lines of defence for Information Security Risk.

Started in IT Audit, moved into risk and governance. Mainly served in financial institutions and regulated environments.

Pet peeves are ineffective third party risk management practices and ignored data privacy right of humans.
